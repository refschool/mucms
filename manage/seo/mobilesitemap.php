A Mobile Sitemap can contain only URLs that serve mobile web content. Any URLs that serve only non-mobile web content will be ignored by the Google crawling mechanisms. If you have non-mobile content, create a separate Sitemap for those URLs.

If the <mobile:mobile/> tag is missing, your mobile URLs won't be properly crawled.
Each Mobile Sitemap must have a unique name.
